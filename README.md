# OCULARüëÅIMAGING
Welcome to the Group 1  Ocular Imaging GitHub repository!!
We are a team of physics students from UCL who have worked together to develop advanced ocular imaging technologies. Our team has divided our efforts between experimental work and coding, with the aim of creating affordable and accessible ocular imaging technologies that can improve the diagnosis and treatment of retinal conditions such as diabetic retinopathy and many others.

To achieve our goals, we have developed several tools and techniques for analyzing and diagnosing retinal conditions. Our work includes the development of a multi-classifier using PyTorch, which accurately classifies retinal images into 5 different stages of diabetic retinopathy. We have also developed a robust bi-classifier using Keras and TensorFlow, which differentiates between healthy and diseased retinal images with an excellent accuracy.

In addition, we have implemented advanced contour detection algorithms that segment different regions of the retina for more precise analysis and diagnosis. Our contour detection algorithms enable us to detect and analyze subtle changes in retinal tissue that may indicate the presence of retinal conditions. We have also developed a fovea detection model that accurately identifies the fovea, a crucial area of the retina responsible for maintaining high visual acuity. The ability to accurately detect and analyze the fovea is critical for diagnosing and treating many retinal conditions.

We invite you to explore our repository, which includes comprehensive documentation and code that can be used for further research and development in the field of ocular imaging. We are excited to share our work and hope to contribute to the advancement of ocular imaging technologies.
